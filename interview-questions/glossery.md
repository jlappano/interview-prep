## Abstraction

> The essence of abstractions is preserving information that is relevant in a given context, and forgetting

â€“ John V. Guttag

Abstraction is a *technique* that wraps and hides computational complexity creating different levels on complexity. This can refer to data constructs as well as actions. A little wavy symbol is an abstraction of the ocean.

## Queue

A "First in, First out" collection of elements. Elements can be pushed to the front of the queue and then shifted from the rear of the queue. 

## Stack 

A "Last in, First Out" collection of elements. Elements can be "pushed" onto the top of the stacked, or "popped" off the top of the stack. We may also look at the top elements without modifying it with a "peek" method. We can implement a stack using an array or a linked list, for example. 

## Tree

A data structure in which a set of linked nodes form a hierarchical tree structure. The top node is called the root, with nodes linked away from the root being children. A node with no children is called a leaf.
